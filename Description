Step 1:
Graph data structure is being used to allot the nearest station from where the user has to board the train. For example, the user selects a train which stops on 2 stations, now the users enter the place where he lives and according to that we will let him know which station is nearest for him .
Step 2:
After getting the source and destination, the user is asked the number of passengers traveling. Then the user will be asked to write the name, age, and gender of passengers. After this, our algorithm will allot the seats to passengers, keeping in mind the gender and age of passengers.
Step 3:
Once the seat allotment is done through Priority queue, we move onto a coupon system. This coupon system takes the user database which includes the userâ€™s name and their travel points. The travel points are assigned to them when they hypothetically traveled using this app in the past. We take this database and push it onto a Linked List #1. Now we have a linked list with all the information about a given user that has used this app before. During Step 2 of this app, the user is asked for the number of travelers and their names and their age and their gender, from that input we make an array of just the names of the travelers. Now from this information, only the names are stored in an array and then this array is used to identify users in the Linked List #1. Once the user is found they are assigned their respective travel points and moved into Linked List #2.
 step 4:
 ARRAY is being used For the selection of train .we have added 4 trains with their respective routes in an  array. Now the user inputs his destination and the the whatever he enters iterates through all the trains arrays values(route) and if the destination that the user entered matches the one of the values of the route of the train , then that train is assigned to the user .
